              “You did not kill the fish only to keep alive and to sell for
              food, he thought. You killed for pride and because you are a
              fisherman. You loved him when he was alive and you loved him
              after. If you love him, it is not a sin to kill him. Or is it
              more?” -- Ernest Hemingway
